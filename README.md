## Project Overview

This project is a web-based assessment result display page. It includes two sections:

1. **Your Result Section (`part1`):**
   - Displays the user's overall result with a circular visual representation.
   - Provides a brief message about the user's performance.

2. **Summary Section (`part2`):**
   - Presents a summary of scores in different categories (Reaction, Memory, Verbal, Visual).
   - Each category has an associated icon, score, and a visual representation.
